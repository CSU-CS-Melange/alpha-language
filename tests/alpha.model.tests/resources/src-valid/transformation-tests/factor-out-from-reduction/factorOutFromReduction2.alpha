/**
 * Test for FactorOutOfReduction.
 *
 * Before the transformation:
 *  - All reductions should only have a Binary/MultiArgExpression as its content to uniquely identify the target.
 *  - The first expression of the Binary/MultiArgExpression can be factored out.
 
 * After the transformation: 
 *  - All reductions should have Binary/MultiArgExpression as its parent. 
 *  - There should be no BinaryExpression or MultiArgExpression within reductions.
