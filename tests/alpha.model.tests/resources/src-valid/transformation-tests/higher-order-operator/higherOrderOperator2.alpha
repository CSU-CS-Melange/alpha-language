/**
 * Test for HigherOrderOperator.
 * In contrast to the test 1, reductions 
 * in these tests have bounded domains.
 *
 * Before the transformation:
 *  - All equations start with a reduction.
 *
 * After the transformation: 
 *  - There should be no reduction left, OR
 *  - The reduction has less dimensions.
