/**
 * Test for HigherOrderOperator.
 * The reduction body in these tests have unbounded
 * context domain, producing polynomials evaluating
 * as infty. These are the same set of tests as
 * Idempotence with a different operator that
 * cound work with unbounded domains.
 *
 * Before the transformation:
 *  - All equations start with a reduction.
 *
 * After the transformation: 
 *  - There should be no reduction left, OR
 *  - The reduction has less dimensions.
