/**
 * These are some manual tests which convert systems into C programs.
 * The programs are written to folders that already contain wrappers,
 * verification code, and a makefile.
 * 
 * To test if a program is correct:
 * 1. Run the "main" method here to generate all of the C files.
 * 2. Open a terminal on a system with "gcc" and "make" installed.
 * 3. Navigate to one of the programs to check.
 * 4. Run "make clean" to clean up any previous build files.
 * 5. Run "make verify-rand" to build the verification program.
 * 6. Run that verification program (which has a suffix of ".verify-rand").
 *    You will need to provide values for the parameters with this command.
 * 7. Look at the output and check that it says that all the tests passed.
 * 8. Repeat steps 3-7 for all programs.
